       <h2>Built-in Contamination</h2>
       <p class="ccparagraph">Metal shavings left in cross drillings,thread sealant, solvents, small pieces of welding slag and metal particals generated from fitting installations are some examples of built-in contamination. Each new component installed in a system can contribute the this type of contamination. Below are are some examples.</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Reservoirs - paint chips, welding slag, solvents and rags left in reservoir</li>
           <li>Pumps - burrs, thread sealant, sand(from casting), solvents and flushing solutions</li>
           <li>Control Valves - burrs, thread sealant, teflon tape, sand(from casting), solvents and flushing solutions</li>
           <li>Pressure and flow control valves - burrs, loctite, teflon tape, sand(from casting), solvents and flushing solutions</li>
           <li>Cylinders - rags, tools, burrs, seal material(from improper installation)solvents and flushing solutions, welding slag</li>
           <li>Hoses - anything airborn that can enter the hose while in storage, pieces if internal tubing generated while pressing on fitting</li>
           <li>Pipe - rust</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Prevention</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Assemble components in a clean environment</li>
           <li>Remove pipe plugs in housings during overhauls, flush with solvent and blow air through all cross drillings</li>
           <li>Making sure new reservoirs are free of paint chips, rust, dirt, weld slag, burrs, tools</li>
           <li>Blowing air through and capping conductors before storing</li>
           <li>Flush manifolds repeatedly, blow air through all ports and passages and wipe clean with a lint free rag</li>
           <li>Thoroughly deburr pumps and cylinders and make sure component is free of welding slag </li>
           <li>Keep all components, including conductors, free of rust</li>
           <li>Only use seals and packings that are compatible with the fluid medium</li>
           <li>Use only clean lubrication or oil for assembly</li>
       </ul>
