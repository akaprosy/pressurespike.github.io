       <h2>External contamination is introduced by either the enviroment in which the system is operating  or during field repairs and maintanence.</h2>  
       <h3>Enviromentally ingressed</h3> 
       <p class="ccparagraph">Reservoir breathers, cylinder rod seals and pump shaft seals are the most common areas where air, water and particulates can infiltrate a system. </p>
       <h4>Prevention</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>Repair leaky shaft seals and cylinder rod seals</li>
           <li>Excercise caution when pressure washing around reservoir breathers and filler caps</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Induced during maintenance and repairs</h3>
       <p class="ccparagraph">System maintanence, component removal and replacement, component overhauls and fluid changes all present opportunities for contaminants to be introduced into a system. </p>
       <h4>Prevention</h4>
       <ul>
       <li>Avoid unnecessary component removal/replacement while troubleshooting</li>
       <li>Avoid leaving system open to the environment for a lengthy period of time</li>
    </ul>
